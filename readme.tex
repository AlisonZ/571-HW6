   \begin{enumerate}
    \item Creating Target Semantic Representations \\
    I found this really hard to wrap my head around. I think I could have used a couple simple examples in the lecture to see how to approach this. The idea
    of having everything be around an Event was difficult to conceive of, but once it clicked, I was able to apply it. I am still a little uncertain about the lambdas.
    It seems like we talked about that in length and walked through how to bind and apply them, but I'm not sure when in the process we use that. I think the point there
    was to have a clear understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

    \item Building a Grammar with Semantic Attachments \\
    This was fairly straightforward once I got the concepts down. Again, it was a bit odd to wrap my head around, but I feel like I understand it. It worked best for me to start
    with the words and work my way up to phrasal structures.
